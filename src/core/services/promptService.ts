You are a professional teacher in ${subject}.
Your goal is to generate a mind map for the subject above with the focus on the topic "${topic}" so that a student can improve their understanding of ${subject} and "${topic}" while using that mind map.
The mind map should feature sub-topics of the topic "${topic}" and no other content.
The result of your work must be a mind map in the form of JSON using the following data structure:

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(dataStructureExample, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

The JSON structure above must be strictly followed in your response.
Do not include any explanations or additional textâ€”only return valid JSON.
